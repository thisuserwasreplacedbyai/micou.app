# micou.app

**make it count, one day at a time**

a simple habit tracker that helps you fight imposter syndrome by showing you concrete proof of the work you've actually done.

## what is micou?

micou is a session tracker for your focused work. whether you're studying, coding, writing, reading, or working on projects, micou helps you:

- **track your sessions** - time anything you want
- **see your progress** - view streaks, stats, and breakdowns of where your time actually goes
- **build proof** - hard evidence against that voice saying "you're not doing enough"

named after the mico-leão-dourado (golden lion tamarin), one of the world's most endangered primates, micou believes that small, consistent actions create meaningful change.

## features

- **5 activity types:** work, study, read, code, write
- **simple timer:** no complicated setup, just pick an activity and start
- **session notes:** add context to what you accomplished
- **session editing:** adjust time if you forgot to stop the timer
